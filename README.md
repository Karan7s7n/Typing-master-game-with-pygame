## **Gameplay**  
🎯 **Objective:** Type the words correctly before they disappear off the screen.  
🎮 **Controls:**

### **Key Components in `typemaster.py`**
📌 **Word Selection from NLTK:**  
- Loads a word list from the **NLTK corpus** and sorts words by length.  
- Different levels control word length selection.  

📌 **Game UI:**  
- Uses **Pygame’s `Surface` and `draw` methods** to render buttons and text.  
- Implements a **pause menu** with clickable buttons.  

📌 **Game Loop & Logic:**  
- Continuously spawns words with random positions and speeds.  
- Tracks user input and updates score accordingly.
